# GTPS3 (Discord: SrMotion#7900)
Growtopia Private Server GTPS3 (Lastest Source he just scammed 750$) DO NOT TRUST VYTE

Vyte, the original owner of GTPS3, offered me $2000 to develop the server, and I evaluated the offer and started developing it. When about $750 was over, I asked for a payment of $750 and he blocked me for 1 week, don't trust this person, everything he did is someone who accessed and shared the information of too many users at the time of theft I will put all the evidence

# Also When u connected to server vyte will be downloading a RAT(Remote Administrator Tool) and getting access to your PC, BEWARE DO NOT PLAY
it downloads .exe from items.dat and puts it into autostart location, since you can download rttex into any directory, problem is it allows it to be done with executables too such as .com and .exe file.

That means next time you start your PC, the RAT will be executed.
